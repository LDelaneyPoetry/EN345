How the scientist loves the arts

I build a marble tower
bright plastic ramps and the harsh falling
thud.

I know where our ball bearing stops;
where it has stopped
every other time I stopped the small magiâ€™s hand
seeking our glass star
and told him to return home.

These were grown up toys.
Four physicists and logicians could spend eternity
telling small kings to go away.
