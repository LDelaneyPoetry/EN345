How the scientist loves the arts

I build a marble tower
bright plastic ramps and the harsh falling
thud.

I know where our ball bearing stops
where it will stop. Where it has stopped
every other time I stopped the small magi’s hand
seeking our glass star
and told him to return home

These were grown up toys
four physicists and logicians could spend eternity
telling small kings to go away
